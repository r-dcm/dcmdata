\format{
\code{ecpe_data} is a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} containing ECPE
response data with 2,922 rows and 29 variables.
\itemize{
\item \code{resp_id}: Respondent identifier.
\item \code{E1}-\code{E28}: Dichotomous item responses to the 28 ECPE items.
}

\code{ecpe_qmatrix} is a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} that identifies
which skills are measured by each ECPE item. This section of the ECPE
contains 28 items measuring 3 skills. The \code{ecpe_qmatrix} correspondingly is
made up of 28 rows and 4 variables.
\itemize{
\item \code{item_id}: Item identifier, corresponds to \code{E1}-\code{E28} in \code{ecpe_data}.
\item \code{morphosyntactic}, \code{cohesive}, and \code{lexical}: Dichotomous indicator for
whether or not the skill is measured by each item. A value of \code{1} indicates
the skill is measured by the item and a value of \code{0} indicates the skill is
not measured by the item.

\description{
This is data from the grammar section of the ECPE, administered annually by
the English Language Institute at the University of Michigan. This data
contains responses to 28 questions from 2,922 respondents, which ask
respondents to complete a sentence with the correct word. This data set has
been used by Templin & Hoffman (2013) and Templin & Bradshaw (2014) for
demonstrating the log-linear cognitive diagnosis model (LCDM) and the
hierarchical diagnostic classification model (HDCM), respectively.
}
\details{
The skills correspond to knowledge of:
\enumerate{
\item Morphosyntactic rules
\item Cohesive rules
\item Lexical rules
}

For more details, see Buck & Tatsuoka (1998) and Henson & Templin (2007).
