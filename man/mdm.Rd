\title{MacReady & Dayton Multiplication Data (MDM)}
\format{
\code{mdm_data} is a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} containing responses
to multiplication items, as described in MacReady and Dayton (1977). There
are 142 rows and 5 variables.
\itemize{
\item \code{respondent}: Respondent identifier.
\item \code{mdm1}-\code{mdm4}: Dichotomous item responses to the 4 multiplication items.
}

\code{mdm_qmatrix} is a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} that identifies
which skills are measured by each MDM item. This MDM data contains 4 items,
all of which measure the skill of multiplication. The \code{mdm_qmatrix}
correspondingly is made up of 4 rows and 2 variables.
\itemize{
\item \code{item}: Item identifier, corresponds to \code{mdm1}-\code{mdm4} in \code{mdm_data}.
\item \code{multiplication}: Dichotomous indicator for whether or not the
multiplication skill is measured by each item. A value of \code{1} indicates the
skill is measured by the item and a value of \code{0} indicates the skill is not
measured by the item.
